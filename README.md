# meetUp
A simple mock application that allows a user to sign up for the service, and then create, edit, and delete events.
This is part of Udacity's Senior Web Developer Nanodegree, and is meant to enforce best practices in creating user-friendly forms.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/zachnagatani/meetUp.git`
2. Run `npm install` (this may take awhile... be patient!)
3. Run `bower install`
4. Run `gulp serve` to serve development files
5. Run `gulp build` and then `gulp serve:dist` to run production ready files

### Usage
1. Sign up (no real backend) as prompted
2. Mock data is used to display the intial events.
3. Create a new event with the link at the top of the page
4. All events can be edited or deleted.
